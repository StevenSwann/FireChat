Welcome to the FireChat wiki!

This project was part of my training at FDM to create at least a single vertical slice of an Web Application of our choice. The aim of the project was to put into practice the skills that we had learnt the previous weeks in the training, work at implementing the user requirements in an agile fashion, reflect on lesson learnt and present it to our colleagues. The time we had to create this project was 2 weeks.

For this project, I chose to try and create a chat system as I wanted to challenge myself with not only putting my .NET skills to the test, but also learn a completely new technology by myself that was not part of the training. As I researched what libraries/technologies would help me achieve the user requirements, I came across SignalR which seemed to offer the tools I needed to successfully implement the system that the product owner envisioned.

To aid my planning and to keep track of my progress, I used Trello as an online kanban board, which you may view here: https://trello.com/b/EQ02i6K1/chat-system-kanban

JQuery was another library that I had no knowledge about previously and so that added to the learning curve.

I tried to adhere to the SOLID principles throughout designing and writing the code, however, looking back, there are definite areas for improvement and refactoring.

All in all, this project was one of my favourite projects to work on and I am quite proud of the result.
